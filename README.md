===============================

Object: state and a behaviour

SOLID design Principle

S --> Single Responsibility
O --> Open Close Prinicple [ closed for Change, open for extension]
L --> Liskov substitution Principle
I --> Interface seggregation
D --> Dependency Injection

================

Compilation Environment
Development Kit:

Source Code --> compile --> bytecode [.class]
Java DK
Groovy DK
Kotlin DK

```
Account.java
    public class Account {
        private double balance;

        public void deposit(double amt) {
            this.balance += amt;
        }

        public double getBalance() {
            return this.balance;
        }
    }

javac Account.java ---> Account.class
```

AccountExample.java
```
    public class AccountExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Account rahulAcc = new Account();
            Account swethaAcc = new Account();
            swethaAcc.deposit(45000);
            System.out.println(swethaAcc.getBalance());
        }
    }

```

classloader:
findLoadedClass()
loadClass()
findSystemClass()
defineClass()

=======

Logically grouping of objects/classes:
1) entity / model / domain
represent a business data / no business logic
Uber
Customer, Driver, Vechicle, Payment, Trip,...

2) DAO --> Data Access Object ==> CRUD operations
3) Service
4) UI
5) Utility
6) Exception

==============

Why program to interface?

1) DESIGN
2) IMPLEMENTATION
3) TESTING
4) INTEGRATION
5) LOOSE COUPLING

Maven permission

```
a) docker pull mysql

b) 
For Windows:
docker run --name local-mysql â€“p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Welcome123 -d mysql

container name given here is "local-mysql"

For Mac:
docker run -p 3306:3306 -d --name local-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Welcome123 mysql

```

FunctionalInterface:
is one where only one method has to be implemented

we can use lambda expressions instead of anonymous class

HOF: High Order Function:
1) function accepting function as an argument
2) function return a function

Commonly used HOF:
1) filter
2) map
3) reduce
4) forEach
6) skip
7) limit

==================================================

Java Concurrency

Process: Program in Execution.
Every process needs to have at least one unit of work running --> Thread

Single Threaded application: notepad, onenote, calculator

Multi-threaded application: Word, Intellij, Browser, excel, ....

Word: typing, spell check, grammer check, auto save,....

Uses of multi-threaded application:
1) Avoid starvation
2) Optimization of resource usage [Threads are light weight process, threads shares resources allocted for process [ loaded classes, objects]]

Word:
Document class
document object --> HEAP area

Java provides:
1) Runnable interface
interface Runnable {
    void run(); // entry point for a thread, just like main() for main thread
}

2) Thread class ==> implements Runnable
contains life-cycle methods to start, sleep, suspend, resume, join, interrupt, stop..

stop, suspend and resume are deprecated --> Not supposed to be used.

======

Thread Safe:
A member is said to be thread safe if it doesn't get effected in multi-threaded environment

* local variables: reside on stack, each thread has a seperate stack --> safe
* static variables: reside in metaspace along with class data --> shared by all threads --> not safe
* instance variables: reside on heap area --> shared by threads --> not safe
* immutable objects: reside on heap --> shared --> safe

wait() and notify()/notifyAll() can be used for inter-thread communication


Thread calls this method:
```
// synchronized acquires a lock
// wait() release a lock
void doTask() {
    wait(); // what happens to this line ==> IllegalMonitorStateException
}
```

Banking Service:

```
class BankingService {

    public  void transferFunds(Account fromAcc, Account toAcc, double amt) {
        synchronized(fromAcc) { // acquire lock of fromAcc
            synchronized(toAcc) { // acquire lock of toAcc
                fromAcc.withdraw(amt);
                toAcc.deposit(amt);
            } // release lock of toAcc
        } // release lock of fromAcc
        
    }
}

class Uitlity {
    public void copyList(List<String> dest, List<String> source) {
        synchronized(dest) {
            syncronized(source) {
                copying from source to destination
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Java 5: fixed few issues with threads
1) only one lock per object [with synchronized]
```
class Account {
    UserData data; // avatar, profilePic, email
    double balance;
}

If transaction is happening, I can't update my avatar
We should have a sperate lock for UserData and another lock for balance

```
2) timeout is not there

3) Deadlock

```
Thread t1 --> SB102 to SB451 5000
Thread t2 --> SB451 to SB102 9000

 public  void transferFunds(Account fromAcc, Account toAcc, double amt) {
        synchronized(fromAcc) { // t1 gets SB102 lock, t2 gets SB451 lock
            synchronized(toAcc) { // t1 wants SB451, t2 wants SB102 lock
                fromAcc.withdraw(amt);
                toAcc.deposit(amt);
            } // release lock of toAcc
        } // release lock of fromAcc
        
    }
```

4) ThreadPool
5) Thread can't return a value

===============


Doug Lea: Concurrent Programming in Java
Lock --> Programmatically locking and unlocking

Deadlock Solution:
```
Thread t1 --> SB102 to SB451 5000
Thread t2 --> SB451 to SB102 9000

public  void transferFunds(Account fromAcc, Account toAcc, double amt) {
            // T1 try to get SB102, T2 gets SB451 lock
            if(fromAcc.balLock.tryLock(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                 try {
                    // T1 try to get SB451
                    if(toAcc.balLock.tryLock(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                          try {
                            fromAcc.withdraw(amt);
                            toAcc.deposit(amt);
                        }
                        finally {
                            toAcc.balLock.unlock();
                        }
                    }
                 } finally{
                    fromAcc.balLock.unlock(); // T1 releases SB102
                 }
       }
        
    }

```

The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread. A Runnable, however, does not return a result and cannot throw a checked exception.

Always prefer ThreadPool instead of start()
latency involved in creating and destroying thread
